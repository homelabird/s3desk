## Objects Page Context Menus
- Right click on a selected object: menu shows selection actions and operates on the selection.
- Right click on an unselected object: selection jumps to that row and menu matches the clicked object.
- Click the row "..." button: selection updates to the row and menu matches the row actions.
- Open a menu and scroll the list: the menu closes and does not float out of place.
